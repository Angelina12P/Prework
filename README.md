# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was built with the intention of creating a webpage where people can easily access information on programming terms. It solves the issue of needing to keep notes seperately. It places them in easy to read boxes and lists. My motivation was also to learn how to code, and I was able to learn the definition and basic elements of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript when creating it. 

## Installation

You can also open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). This will open a panel from which you can get a list of the subjecfts and a suggestion for which to look at first.
